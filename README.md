# External-Merge-Sort-and-Selection
External Merge-Sort and Selection implementation to handle data that is large enough to fit in main memory

The program expects to get an text file input representing sql table where each column is seperated by a whitespace. 

The program supports 3 operations: 

Sort - which sorts the input file according to a given column number. 

Select - which selects the relevant rows in the table according to a given column number and a given substring, that must be a substring of every value in the given column number.

Sort and Select - which combines between the two previous operations.
